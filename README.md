NVide is a modern NeoVim configuration designed to deliver a smooth and intuitive development experience, especially for developers who appreciate the usability of GUI editors, but crave the performance and flexibility of terminal-based tools.

This configuration bridges that gap by providing a NeoVim setup that:
- Mimics common Visual Studio Code behaviors and shortcuts.
- Offers GUI-like UX elements via plugins.
- Runs entirely in the terminal, making it ultra-portable and resource-friendly

Whether you’re switching from Visual Studio Code, or you simply want a fast IDE-like setup in the terminal, NVide gives you the experience you're used to, with the performance you've always wanted.

#### About

NVide is heavily inspired by the **[Micro Editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)**. Since Micro isn’t very popular and lacks a wide range of plugins, I decided to make NeoVim resemble it as closely as possible through NVide.
